# Product Requirements Document: App Store Migration - Native iOS & Android Apps

## Executive Summary

**Problem Statement**: This feature addresses: ## Overview
Migrate the Fidget Fun Progressive Web App to native iOS and Android applications deployable to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store while maintaining all existing functionality and improving native integration.

## Business Goals
- Expand distribution channels beyond web browsers to major app stores
- Increase discoverability through app store search and featured listings
- Provide better native OS integration (haptics, notifications, permissions)
- Maintain existing PWA for users who prefer web access
- Enable future monetization opportunities through in-app purchases

## Technical Approach
Use **Capacitor** (by Ionic) to wrap the existing vanilla JS/HTML/CSS web app into native iOS and Android containers. This approach minimizes code changes while providing native capabilities.

### Why Capacitor?
1. **Minimal Migration Effort** - Wraps existing web code without rewriting
2. **Native Access** - Provides APIs for haptics, storage, status bar, etc.
3. **No Build Process Required** - Works with vanilla JS (no React/Vue needed)
4. **Active Maintenance** - Well-supported by Ionic team
5. **App Store Compliant** - Generates native projects suitable for submission

## Core Requirements

### 1. Project Setup & Configuration
- Install and configure Capacitor CLI and dependencies
- Initialize native iOS (Xcode) and Android (Android Studio) projects
- Configure app identifiers: `com.fidgetfun.app` or similar
- Set up development environment prerequisites (Node.js, Xcode, Android Studio)
- Create build scripts for both platforms

### 2. Web App Adaptation
- **Remove GitHub Pages paths** - Change BASE_PATH from '/silly-apps/' to '/' for native builds
- **Update Service Worker** - Make offline caching conditional (use native storage APIs when available)
- **Responsive Layout** - Ensure safe-area-inset handling works on all device sizes
- **Asset Management** - Bundle all assets (icons, fonts) within native packages
- **Remove PWA manifest** or adapt for Capacitor's app.json config

### 3. Native Integration

#### iOS Specific
- Configure Info.plist with required permissions
- Implement proper haptic feedback using Capacitor Haptics API (replace Vibration API)
- Handle iOS safe area insets (notch, Dynamic Island)
- Configure launch screen (splash screen)
- Set up proper app icons for all iOS sizes
- Test on iPhone and iPad (different layouts if needed)
- Ensure app works on iOS 14+ minimum

#### Android Specific
- Configure AndroidManifest.xml with permissions
- Implement Material Design haptic patterns
- Handle Android system bars and notches
- Configure adaptive icons for Android 8+
- Set up splash screen
- Ensure app works on Android 8.0+ minimum (API 26+)

#### Cross-Platform Native Features
- Replace browser Vibration API with Capacitor Haptics plugin
- Use Capacitor Storage API for persistent data (better than localStorage)
- Implement proper status bar styling (dark/light content)
- Add splash screen with app branding
- Handle app lifecycle events (pause, resume, background)

### 4. Feature Parity & Testing
Ensure all existing PWA features work identically:
- ✅ Buttons screen with particle effects
- ✅ Spinner physics and interactions
- ✅ RGB sliders
- ✅ Pop It grid
- ✅ Drawing pad (canvas)
- ✅ Tab navigation
- ✅ Haptic feedback (upgraded to native)
- ✅ Offline functionality
- ✅ All animations and visual effects

### 5. App Store Assets & Metadata

#### iOS App Store
- App icons: 1024x1024 PNG (no transparency)
- Screenshots: Required for all device sizes (iPhone 6.7", 6.5", 5.5", iPad Pro 12.9", etc.)
- Privacy policy URL (required for App Store Connect)
- App description, keywords, category
- Age rating (likely 4+ or Everyone)
- Support URL

#### Google Play Store
- App icon: 512x512 PNG (with transparency optional)
- Feature graphic: 1024x500 PNG
- Screenshots: At least 2, up to 8 per device type
- Short description (80 chars), full description (4000 chars)
- Privacy policy URL
- Content rating via questionnaire
- App category

### 6. Build & Deployment Process
- iOS: Archive build → TestFlight → App Store submission
- Android: Generate signed APK/AAB → Internal testing → Production release
- Document build process for future updates
- Set up version numbering strategy (semantic versioning)
- Create release checklist
