## Design Iteration Process

### Phase 1: Design Exploration

**Your Tasks**:
1. Create design mockup (Figma, Sketch, hand-drawn, screenshot, etc.)
2. Save to `design/proposed/[feature-name]/`
3. Create specification document

**Example Design Spec** (`design/proposed/spinner-galaxy-v2/spec.md`):

```markdown
# Galaxy Spinner V2 - Design Specification

## Concept
Enhanced galaxy spinner with animated nebula background and particle trails

## Visual Changes
- Background: Animated gradient (purple #667eea → blue #2196F3)
- Particles: Add comet trails when spinning fast
- Planets: Glow effect on orbit paths
- Center: Pulsing star with radial gradient

## Interaction Changes
- Haptic feedback: Different patterns for different speeds
- Sound: Whoosh sound when spinning fast
- Visual feedback: Speed-based blur effect

## Technical Requirements
- Canvas layer for particle trails
- Requestanimationframe for smooth animation
- Performance: Must maintain 60fps

## Inspiration
[Include screenshot or link to reference]

## Questions/Concerns
- Will particle trails impact performance on older devices?
- Should we add toggle to disable effects?
```

---

### Phase 2: Claude Review & Feedback

**Process**:

1. **Upload Design to Claude Desktop**:
   - Drag and drop mockup image into chat
   - Or provide path to design files
   - Share spec.md content

2. **Request Claude Analysis**:

**Example Prompt**:
```
I've created a new design for the Galaxy Spinner. Please review:

1. Analyze the mockup (attached image)
2. Review the spec at design/proposed/spinner-galaxy-v2/spec.md
3. Provide feedback on:
   - Feasibility (can we implement with current tech stack?)
   - Performance concerns
   - Design consistency with existing app
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Suggestions for improvement

4. If approved, create an implementation plan
```

3. **Claude Provides Feedback**:

Claude will create `design/proposed/spinner-galaxy-v2/feedback.md`:

```markdown
# Galaxy Spinner V2 - Claude Analysis

## ✅ Strengths
- Beautiful visual concept aligns with current galaxy theme
- Particle trails add satisfying visual feedback
- Pulsing star creates focal point

## ⚠️ Concerns
- **Performance**: Particle trails may drop FPS on older devices
  - Mitigation: Add particle limit based on device performance
- **Battery**: Canvas animations can drain battery
  - Mitigation: Reduce particles when battery < 20%
- **Accessibility**: Fast animations may cause motion sickness
  - Mitigation: Add "Reduce Motion" setting

## 💡 Suggestions
1. Add toggle: "High Performance Mode" vs "Battery Saver"
2. Detect device capability and auto-adjust particle count
3. Use CSS transforms instead of canvas where possible
4. Implement particle pooling to reduce GC pressure

## 🔧 Technical Approach
- Layer 1: CSS gradient background (GPU accelerated)
- Layer 2: SVG planets and orbits
- Layer 3: Canvas for particle trails only
- Use `will-change` CSS property for performance

## 📋 Implementation Plan
1. Create new spinner design variant
2. Implement particle system with pooling
3. Add performance detection
4. Add settings toggle
5. Test on iPhone SE (worst case device)
6. A/B test with current galaxy spinner

## ⏱️ Estimated Effort
- Implementation: 4-6 hours
- Testing: 2 hours
- Performance optimization: 2-4 hours
- Total: 8-12 hours

## Recommendation
✅ **APPROVED** with suggested mitigations
```

---

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

**Create FORGE Design Cycle** (for complex designs):

```bash
# Create new cycle for this design iteration
forge_new_cycle \
  --feature "Galaxy Spinner V2 Enhancement" \
  --description "Implement enhanced galaxy spinner with particle trails, animated background, and performance optimizations" \
  --priority medium
```

**Or use simple task tracking** (for minor design tweaks):

Create `design/proposed/spinner-galaxy-v2/tasks.md`:

```markdown

### Phase 4: Claude Implementation

**Iterative Implementation Process**:

#### Step 1: Request Implementation

**Example Prompt**:
```
Let's implement the Galaxy Spinner V2 design. Start with Phase 1 (Core Visual Updates):

1. Read the current spinner code: www/app.js (lines 279-450)
2. Read the design spec: design/proposed/spinner-galaxy-v2/spec.md
3. Implement the gradient background animation
4. Add the pulsing star effect

Please show me the updated code with comments explaining changes.
```

#### Step 2: Claude Implements

Claude will:
- Read current implementation
- Analyze design requirements
- Write updated code
- Provide explanation of changes

#### Step 3: Review & Test

**You**:
1. Review Claude's code
2. Test in browser/simulator
3. Provide feedback

**Example Feedback**:
```
The gradient looks great! But the pulsing star is too fast.
Can you slow it down to 2 seconds per pulse instead of 1 second?
Also, can we make the glow effect more subtle?
```

#### Step 4: Claude Refines

Claude adjusts based on your feedback, iterates until perfect.

#### Step 5: Commit & Document

```bash
# Commit changes
git add www/app.js www/styles.css
git commit -m "feat: Implement Galaxy Spinner V2 with particle trails

- Added gradient background animation
- Implemented pulsing star center effect
- Added glow to orbit paths
- Optimized for 60fps on iPhone SE

## Tips for Effective Design Collaboration

### 1. Be Specific
❌ "Make it look better"
✅ "Increase button size by 20%, add drop shadow, use warmer colors"

### 2. Provide Context
❌ [Just shares image]
✅ [Shares image] "This is for low-light usage, needs to be dark mode friendly"

### 3. Iterate Incrementally
❌ "Redesign the entire app"
✅ "Let's start with the Buttons screen, then move to Spinner"

### 4. Reference Examples
❌ "Make it modern"
✅ [Shows 3 apps] "I like the animations in App A, colors in App B, layout in App C"

### 5. Set Constraints
❌ "Do whatever looks good"
✅ "Keep vanilla JS, no new dependencies, must work offline, <10KB added"
